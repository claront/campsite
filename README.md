# Campsite App - angular-seed to AngularJS tutorial app

The idea with my [Campsite App](https://github.com/claront/campsite) is to use the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), and follow the steps in the [PhoneCat Tutorial App](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) to turn the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) into an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) app with some interesting functionality.  I replace the phones with campsites to make it more interesting for me.  For more details on what is going on, see the documentation for:
