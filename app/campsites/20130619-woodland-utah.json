    "description": "Woodland, Utah is a picturesque little town on the edge of the Uintah Mountains.  I camped on the concrete pad of a park pavilion of the local church.  My grandson joined me for the night and the next two days.  It got down to about 35 degrees at night.  No store or restaurant in the little town, so bring your own food.",
