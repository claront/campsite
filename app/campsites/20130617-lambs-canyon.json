    "description": "Beautiful spot for my first campsite on the thousand mile walk.  The grass was more than waist high and thick.  I manhandled my cart through a ditch to get off the frontage road of the freeway.  I was the only camper to have used the spot maybe this year.  There was a trail runner out for a training run through the mountains who was surprised to come across me.  He gave me several granola bars that he wasn't going to need that day.  If I looked away from the road and ignored the freeway noise, it seemed like a pristine spot.",

    "comments": "It was not an official campsite, but what is commonly referred to as a rough camp.  No culinary water, toilets or picnic table, but just the natural beauty of being in the mountains in early summer.  It made me a little nervous not knowing who owned the property.  I had not gotten anyone's permission to camp here.  I cheated on this campsite in that I had driven my car up a few days before to scout out a camping spot.  This is only camping spot on the walk with which I had that luxury."
